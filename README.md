This intended to be a spot to develop a collection of insights, tips, scripts, and examples from my four years of using OpenSCAD for engineering and parametric design. This repo is an informal knowledge dump—expect scattered but useful information.

## Why This Exists

OpenSCAD is powerful, but mastering it takes time. Over the years, I've learned techniques that make parametric modeling more efficient, flexible, and practical. Instead of letting this knowledge sit in my head (or in random files), I'm sharing it here for others to learn from.

## What You'll Find

- **Scripts** – Reusable OpenSCAD snippets for common problems.
- **Examples** – Real-world parametric designs and patterns.
- **Notes** – Observations on best practices, pitfalls, and performance.
