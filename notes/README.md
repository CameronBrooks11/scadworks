# Tips

- Plan out your design first by writing on paper or something else as long as you arent coding (more on this below), THEN use that to create a list of variables and assign approx values as you go, THEN
  - When planning your design:
    - dont neglect proper engineering process, think about the goal, constraints, requirements, etc - really think about what the thing you are designing is intended for
    - KISS!!
